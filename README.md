# Lab08-LINQ_in_Manhattan

# Description

- Upon runtime, the application will display various lists which output neighborhoods. The application takes in a JSON file and parses it into variout lists to utilize LINQ queries and Lambda expressions.

# Sepcifications

-	One method utilized to read and parse the JSON file into objects which include various properties that you can then iterate through

- A display method to print each object on the console

- Two seperate methods utilized to remove neighborhoods without names that where imported from JSON file. One of which utilizes LINQ queries and the other utilizes a Lambda expression.

- One method that leverages a Lambda expression to remove potential duplicates imported from JSON file.

-One method that utilizes a Lambda expression to both remove unnamed neighborhoods and remove duplicates.
